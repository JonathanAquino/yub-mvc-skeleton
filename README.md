A social command line for the web! This is the source code for http://yubnub.org/.

Yubnub was written by Jonathan Aquino for the Rails Day 2005 programming
competition. He then ported it to PHP in 2013.

Apologies for the poor quality of the HTML and CSS. They were written back when
I didn't know much about web design best practices, back in 2005. The PHP is
more recent (2013) and is of better quality.
